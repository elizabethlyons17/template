			<p>The purpose of this video is for the grandson of an Evangelist Oral Roberts to share a letter he wrote to
			his dead Uncle Ronnie. Ronnie was gay just like him and after he divorced his wife and was afraid of losing
			his kids he became depressed and wrote to his Uncle Ronnie who commited suicide about how it gets better. 
			The video is of him reading part of the letter encouraging positivy and saying everyone is beautiful and 
			deserves happiness. The video attempts to do this by making the message appear in a very powerful and
			passionate way. Before and after the reading there is writings giving details of the story. By doing
			this it makes the message feel more powerful. The structure of the message was readings before the 
			oral story and then after he was done reading it concluded with more reading promoting the message that
			it gets better. I haven't finished the Lived Expierence project but the video helped me with how I will
			think about it and organize it. He drew from past expierence to create a narrative that flowed well and 
			was organized cronlogically so it was easy to follow and interesting. </p>
